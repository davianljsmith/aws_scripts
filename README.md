# AWS Scripts 

This repo contains random bash/python scripts that I have created to automate menial or repetitive tasks.

This was created to delete the inbound/outbound rules that allow all traffic in the default VPC security groups. 
** Note: The default output for AWS CLI is text.  Add ```--output text``` flag to commands to override default output to text. **
